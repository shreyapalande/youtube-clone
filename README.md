# ProVid-A-YouTube-Clone

ProVid is a YouTube clone developed by Om Patel and hosted on Netlify. The platform has gained popularity for its responsive and aesthetically pleasing design that ensures seamless user experience across different devices. One of the standout features of ProVid is its effective utilization of MaterialUI, which provides a visually appealing and intuitive interface for users to navigate. Additionally, the clone was built using ReactJS, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, which allows for greater flexibility and customization. Overall, ProVid is a great example of a well-designed and functional video sharing platform that has taken advantage of the latest web development technologies.

This Project is hosted in Netlify : [ProVid by Om Patel](https://providbyom.netlify.app/)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
